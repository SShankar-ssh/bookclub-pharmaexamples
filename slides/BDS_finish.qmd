# What is BDS?

- **BDS** = Basic Data Structure
- A flexible ADaM format used for most subject-level analysis datasets
- Key features:
  - One record per subject, parameter, and timepoint
  - Standardized variables: `PARAMCD`, `AVAL`, `ADY`, `TRTP`, etc.
  - Derived from SDTM + ADSL



# BDS Subtypes - part 1

BDS is used for different analysis goals:

::: nonincremental

| Subtype         | Purpose (in simple terms)                                                                 | Examples         |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Findings        | For things we measure repeatedly during the study, like blood pressure or lab tests       | ADVS, ADLB, ADPC |
| Exposure        | Describes what treatment the subject actually received — how much, how often, how long    | ADEX             |
| Time-to-Event   | Tracks how long it takes for something important to happen (like death, relapse, etc.)    | ADTTE            |

# BDS Subtypes - part2

BDS is used for different analysis goals:

::: nonincremental


| Subtype         | Purpose (in simple terms)                                                                 | Examples         |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Response        | Records the subject's response to treatment, usually as categories like "improved" or "worsened" | ADRS             |
| PK Parameters   | Shows how the drug behaves in the body: absorption, concentration, elimination, etc.      | ADPPK            |

All share the same core structure, adapted for their purpose.



# Common BDS Datasets

## ADPC – Pharmacokinetics Concentrations

- Based on SDTM PC (Pharmacokinetics Concentrations) domain  
- Measures drug levels in biofluids (e.g. plasma)  
- Used in non-compartmental PK analysis  


## ADPPK – PK Parameters

- Based on ADPC results  
- Derived AUC (Area Under Curve), Cmax (Maximum Concentration), Tmax (Time to Max Concentration), etc.  
- Used for dose-response modeling  


## ADRS – Response Data

- Derived from RS (Disease Response), TU (Tumor Identification), TR (Tumor Results) domains  
- Categorical outcomes: CR (Complete Response), PR (Partial Response), SD (Stable Disease), PD (Progressive Disease)  
- Often used in oncology  


## ADTTE – Time to Event

- Based on ADSL (Subject-Level) and AE (Adverse Events), DS (Disposition), VS (Vital Signs) events  
- Used for endpoints like OS (Overall Survival), PFS (Progression-Free Survival), time to death  
- Key variables: `AVAL`, `CNSR` (Censoring), `STARTDT`, `ADT` (Analysis Date)  


## ADVS – Vital Signs

- Based on SDTM VS (Vital Signs) domain  
- Derives BMI (Body Mass Index), MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure), etc.  
- Used in safety summaries  


# Variable Types in BDS - part 1

We group derived variables by **purpose**:

- Timing
- Parameter Identification
- Results
- Derived Parameters
- Reference Ranges

# Variable Types in BDS - part 2

We group derived variables by **purpose**:

- Baseline & Change
- Flags
- Treatment
- Categorization
- Criterion-Based Flags
- Row creation / imputation


## Timing Variables

These variables place each observation in the study timeline and help track when it occurred relative to treatment, visits, or other study milestones.

::: nonincremental
| Variable | Description | Why it's Needed |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `ADT` | Analysis date | Anchors timepoint in study |
| `ADTM` | Analysis datetime | Adds time granularity |
| `ADY` | Relative study day | For analysis over time |
:::


## Timing Variables

These variables place each observation in the study timeline and help track when it occurred relative to treatment, visits, or other study milestones.

::: nonincremental
| Variable | Description | Why it's Needed |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `ADTF`, `ATMF` | Imputation flags | Tracks incomplete dates |
| `AVISIT`, `AVISITN` | Visit name/number | Sorting & summaries |
| `APHASE`, `APERIOD` | Study phase/period | For grouping data |
| `ONTRTFL` | On-treatment flag | Treatment window check |
:::


## Parameter Identification

These variables define what is being measured — each record in BDS must correspond to a unique parameter per subject per timepoint.

::: nonincremental
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PARAMCD` | Short parameter code |
| `PARAM` | Full parameter name |
| `PARAMN` | Numeric ID (optional) |
| `PARCAT1`, `PARCAT2` | Parameter categories |
:::


## Result Variables

These variables store the main output of analysis — either numeric results or their character equivalents and categorized forms.

::: nonincremental
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AVAL` | Numeric result |
| `AVALC` | Character result |
| `AVALCATy` | Categorization (e.g. low/normal/high) |
:::


## Derived Parameters

Used to compute secondary or composite measurements derived from primary variables, such as BMI or MAP.

::: nonincremental
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `BMI`, `MAP`, etc. | Derived from base measurements |
:::


## Reference Ranges

These help classify whether values are within normal clinical limits, often based on lab ranges.

::: nonincremental
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ANRLO`, `ANRHI` | Normal limits |
| `ANRIND` | Low/High/Normal flag |
| `BNRIND` | Baseline version of ANRIND |
:::


## Baseline & Change

These variables allow comparison of on-treatment values to a defined pre-treatment baseline.

::: nonincremental
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `BASE` | Baseline value |
| `CHG` | Change from baseline |
| `PCHG` | Percent change |
| `ABLFL` | Baseline flag |
| `BASETYPE` | Type of baseline measurement |
:::


## Flags & Filtering

Binary flags are used to identify records relevant to specific analyses or TLGs.

::: nonincremental
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ANL01FL` | Primary analysis record flag |
| `ASEQ` | Sequence number |
:::


## Treatment Assignment

Used to categorize subjects by planned and actual treatment arms.

::: nonincremental
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `TRTA` | Actual treatment |
| `TRTP` | Planned treatment |
:::


## Categorization & Criteria

Used to apply clinical cutoffs or create groupings based on results.

::: nonincremental
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AVALCATy` | Categorized values |
| `CRITy`, `CRITyFL`, `CRITyFN` | Threshold logic (e.g., BP > 180) |
:::


## ADSL Merge & New Rows

Derived BDS datasets also pull in subject-level attributes from ADSL, and may create new rows summarizing or imputing data.

- Add subject-level variables from ADSL (e.g. `AGE`, `SEX`, `TRTSDT`)
- Derive new records (e.g. summary rows, worst value, average across visits)


# Hands-On Workshop: BDS – Findings

We will derive a BDS Findings dataset using `{admiral}`.

Link: [https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/bds_finding.html](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/bds_finding.html)

Key steps:
- Read SDTM data
- Derive `ADT`, `ADY`
- Assign `PARAMCD`, `PARAM`
- Derive `AVAL`, `BASE`, `CHG`, `ANL01FL`, etc.
- Merge with ADSL
- Add labels and attributes

Repository: [GitHub Code](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/blob/main/vignettes/bds_finding.Rmd)



# Other BDS Types Work Similarly

Once you master Findings-type BDS, the rest follow similar logic:

- TTE: uses `CNSR`, event definitions
- Exposure: aggregates dose/duration from EX

Further examples:

- [Exposure BDS](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/bds_exposure.html)
